The sample testing scenario is in Java, so I did this in Java, which would make things a little bit easier when writing test cases.

As the test doesn't require any main class or entry point, I didn't include main class. However the required interfaces can be found in `Match.java`, and `MatchTest.java` can be used for testing purpose. I included the sample testings as one test case.
